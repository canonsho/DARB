# DARB
This is a repository for Darb, an application for a graduation project in UQU.

Our system, known as Darb, is a comprehensive application designed to enhance the trip management experience for users.
Darb makes it easy to create an account and journalize trips, allowing users to plan their trips efficiently. 
With an easy-to-use interface, the app allows you to explore different destinations, and provides information such as descriptions,
photos for each location. Noteworthy features include the ability to choose trip budgets, and share travel experiences on community pages.
In developing Darb, the project methodology involved addressing specific functional requirements to ensure a robust and user-centric application.
Key aspects of user administration, including creating, authenticating, and managing user accounts,
are prioritized. The app enables users to view their saved attractions in a summary page,
and share their travel experiences in the community page. The search function allows users to explore destinations and add them to their trip summary page,
while the trip planning feature supports the creation of itineraries containing attractions in the cites user have chosen. Additional functionality,
such as budget choosing, search for destination, view map and traffic status, community features,
contribute to the overall usefulness and engagement of Darb. The feedback service improves the user experience,
making Darb a comprehensive and easy-to-use travel companion.
